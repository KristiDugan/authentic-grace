							"Even though I had my little one two years ago, I was still having a hard time
							finding clothing I felt suited me. Authentic Grace's wonderful customer service
							reps actually took the time to listen to my needs (and let me vent!) and helped me
							find a dress for my first formal outing since giving birth."</p>

							"They are both simply forms of imitation," remarked Lord Henry. "But do let us go.
							Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good for one's morals to see
							bad acting. Besides, I don't suppose you will want your wife to act, so what does
							it matter if she plays Juliet like a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she
							knows as little about life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience.
							There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating--people who know absolutely
							everything, and people who know absolutely nothing. Good heavens, my dear boy, don't look
							so tragic! The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.
							Come to the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of
							Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What more can you want?"</p>
