					"Even though I had my little one two years ago, I was still having a hard time 
					finding clothing I felt suited me. Authentic Grace's wonderful customer service 
					reps actually took the time to listen to my needs (and let me vent!) and helped me 
					find a dress for my first formal outing since giving birth."</p>

				<em>"So much more than just clothes"</em>

					"They are both simply forms of imitation," remarked Lord Henry. "But do let us go.
					 Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good for one's morals to see 
					 bad acting. Besides, I don't suppose you will want your wife to act, so what does 
					 it matter if she plays Juliet like a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she
					 knows as little about life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience. 
					 There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating--people who know absolutely
					 everything, and people who know absolutely nothing. Good heavens, my dear boy, don't look
					 so tragic! The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.
					 Come to the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of 
					 Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What more can you want?"</p>
